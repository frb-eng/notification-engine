# Notification Engine

## Overview

The **Notification Engine** is a scalable and efficient system designed to handle and distribute real-time notifications. It leverages modern cloud and messaging technologies to ensure cost-effectiveness and high performance.

## Features

- **Incoming Call Notifications**: Notifies users when a friend is calling in real-time.
- **Email Notifications**: Sends alerts when a friend sends an email.
- **Message Notifications**: Delivers real-time notifications for messages received from friends.

## Architecture

The Notification Engine is built with a modular approach to ensure scalability and flexibility. It includes:
- **Event-driven architecture** using message queues or event buses (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Azure Event Grid).
- **Microservices-based notification handling** for different types of notifications.
- **Cloud-native deployment** for scalability and reliability.
- **Push based notifications** to cater to different use cases.

## Key Considerations
We aim to optimize the Notification Engine by addressing the following key questions:

1. Resource Consumption vs. Load
  - How does the system scale under different loads?
  - What are the CPU, memory, and network usage patterns as message throughput increases?
  - What optimizations can be applied to reduce unnecessary resource consumption?
2. Cost Progression vs. Load
  - How do cloud costs scale with increasing notification traffic?
  - What are the cost implications of different messaging infrastructures?
  - How can cost-efficiency be improved while maintaining performance?
3. Failure Tolerance & Resilience
  - What mechanisms can be implemented to ensure system reliability in case of partial failures?
  - How does the system recover from message queue failures, database downtimes, or network outages?
  - What redundancy and failover strategies should be in place to minimize downtime?
